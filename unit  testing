The Unit Test layer is easier to test and enables earlier bug detection. 

1.Faster Feedback: unit tests are typically fast, providing quick feedback to developers
2. Isolated Testing: unit tests focus on small, isolated pieces of code, making it easier to identify issues
3.Lower Complexity: unit tests are simpler and less prone to flaky failures
4. Early Detection: catching bugs at the unit level prevents them from propagating to higher levels of the application

focusing on unit tests, developers can:
1. Write Better Code: test-driven development (TDD) encourages good design and coding practices
2. Catch Bugs Early: identify and fix issues quickly, reducing debugging time and costs
3. Improve Overall Quality: a solid foundation of unit tests sets the stage for higher-quality software
