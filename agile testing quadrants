Agile Testing Quadrants are a practical tool for sorting testing types into four categories. 
Quadrant 1: Technology Facing
 This quadrant is all about supporting the team from a technological angle.
It centers on testing the code through unit tests and component tests.
Quadrant 2: Business Facing
 the focus shifts to supporting the team from a business perspective.
Testing activities revolve around business rules, employing functional tests, examples, story tests,prototypes, and simulations.
Quadrant 3: Supporting the Team
 introduces techniques that assist the team in critiquing the product by approaching itfrom a business perspective.
It includes exploratory testing, scenarios, usability testing, user acceptance testing, and alpha andbeta testing.
Quadrant 4: Critique Product
The fourth quadrant dives deep into scrutinizing the product from a technological perspective.
It recommends using performance testing, load testing, security testing, and various “ility” testing types such as accessibility, reliability, and portability.
Manual testing is best suited for Q3: Business Facing, Critiquing the Product.
This quadrant focuses on exploratory testing, usability testing, and other activities that require human intuition and creativity. 
Manual testing is ideal for:
1.Exploratory Testing: discovering issues and edge cases that automated tests might miss.
2. Usability Testing: evaluating the user experience and identifying usability issues.
